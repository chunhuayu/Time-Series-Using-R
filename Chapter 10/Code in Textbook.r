# The argument seasonal supplies the information on the seasonal part of the seasonal ARIMA model. 
# It expects a list with the seasonal order supplied in the component named order and the seasonal period entered via 
# the period component, so 
# the command above instructs the arima function to fit a seasonal ARIMA (0,1,1) Ã— (0,1,1)12 model to the co2 series.
m1.co2
# This prints a summary of the fitted seasonal ARIMA model.
