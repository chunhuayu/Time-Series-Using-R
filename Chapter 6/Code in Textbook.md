acf(ma2.s,ci.type='ma',xaxp=c(0,20,10))
# The argument ci.type='ma' instructs R to plot the sample ACF with the confidence band for the kth lag ACF computed based on 
# the assumption of an MA(k âˆ’ 1) model. See Equation (6.1.11) on page 112 for details.

eacf(arma11.s)
# This computes the sample EACF function (extended autocorrelation function) of the data arma11.s.
# The maximum AR and MA orders can be set via the ar.max and ma.max arguments. 
# Their default values are seven and thirteen, respectively. 
# computes the EACF with maxi- mum AR and MA orders of 10. 
# The EACF function prints a table of symbols with X standing for a significant value and O a nonsignificant value.

# This loads the uroot library and the following commands illustrate the computation of the Dickey-Fuller unit-root test.

# This command finds the AR order for the differenced series, which is order 8, by the minimum AIC criterion.
ar(diff(rwalk))

# This computes the ADF test for the data rwalk. The selectlags argument takes a list as its value. 
# The mode argument specifies which lags must be included, and if it is absent, then the Pmax argument sets the maximum lag 
# and the ADF.test function determines which lags to include in the test using several methods by setting the mode to signif, 
# aic, or bic. The option signif is the default value for mode, 
# which estimates a subset AR model by retaining only significant lags. The argument itsd expects a vector; 
# the first two elements are binary, indicating whether to include a constant term (if the first element is 1) 
# or a linear time trend (if the second element is 1); 
# and the third element zero if there are no more covariates to include in the model. 
# See the help pages for the ADF.test function to learn more about it. 
# Hence, the R command instructs ADF.test to carry out the test with the null hypothesis that the model has a unit root 
# and an intercept term. The alternative is that the model is stationary, so a small p-value implies stationarity!
ADF.test(rwalk,selectlags=list(mode=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8), Pmax=8),itsd=c(1,0,0))
ADF.test(rwalk,selectlags=list(Pmax=0),itsd=c(1,0,0))
# In comparison, the preceding command carries out the ADF test with the null hypothesis being that the model has a unit root, an intercept but no other lags, whereas the alter- native specifies that the model is a stationary AR(1) model with an intercept. If itsd=c(0,0,0), then the alternative model is a centered stationary AR(1) model, that is, with zero mean. Such a hypothesis is not relevant unless the data are already mean-corrected.
